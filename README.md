# Scala for Visual Studio

Scala language support for Visual Studio (an experiment). This is an experiment in that I'm exploring how to add a new language to Visual Studio. This will require lots of learning and trial and error.

I will try to document my journey here. Feel free to join and submit pull requests.

## Goals
The first goal will be to be able to open a Scala project, get syntax highlighting, and be able to compile & run it.

## Current progress
### Done
* Syntax highlighting through [Scala TextMate bundle by mads379](https://github.com/mads379/scala.tmbundle)
* Wix installer

### Next
* Add project and item templates to installer
* Add project system support for .scala files
* Add build support for scala compiler
